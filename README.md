# 3110-final-proj
CS 3110 final project for ai93, nca28, bas339

ai93:
* we're doing the final project using the agile framework so i think creating a tool for the agile framework would be kinda cool

Project Timeline:
* MS1 (Oct 24)
    Satisfactory:
      Database - basic coding
      Main queries for the database: add, delete
      Come up with sample data (we can be the guinea pigsüêÄ)
    Good:
      Add another query: update.
      Basic plan of the command line UI.
    Excellent:
      Think of our own data file architecture.
      Efficient operations on the database. üòÑ
* MS2 (Nov 13)
    Working database queries into a text file of our type. 
    Command-line REPL, including greeting, logging in (of some sort)
    Basic task/team management, creation, retrieval, deletion.
    Chaining database commands together, i.e. parsing of query scripts.
* MS3 (RELEASE - after dec 12?)
    No errors lol, works how we intended
    Working REPL for the main functionality within the command line.
    Access via a server, potential front-end implementation.
    Flesh out Agile management tools

Key Features:
  * Tasks (issues)
    * Tasks show up as blocks on a day at the starting screen for the user.
    * Have descriptions.
    * Ability to add, delete, edit, depending on the access permissions.
    * Filters on task types.
  * Prioritising tasks, i.e. order how tasks come up to the user in the interface.
  * Could make a ‚Äúcalendar‚Äù view (different scales, i.e. month, week, etc.), seeing tasks by when they‚Äôre due.
    * Reflective of google calendar in that sense.
  * Categories of tasks:
    * To do
    * Done
    * In progress
    * Testing
    * Ability to add custom ones
    * Sprint task options, i.e. Backlog, Selected for Development, etc.
  * Users - shown at top
